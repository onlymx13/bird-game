In this game, the player and the AI opponent take turns making attacks and using Powers. You may skip either, both, or neither of these turns, and you may take them in either order. Attacks typically do damage to opposing birds, reducing their health, and Powers typically have some other desirable effect, such as healing friendly birds or summoning additional birds to your side.
Note that there is no maximum health, so birds can be "healed" above their starting health.
## Bird documentation
### Robin
The Robin has the Power to heal friendly birds by 3 health points. Beware, however, as this will use up your Robin entirely! 1 damage, 5 health. There are 2 Robins present in the game.
### Crow
The Crow's Power is to caw at an enemy bird. A bird that is cawed is unable to attack or use its power for 1 turn. The Crow may only caw once per game. 1 damage, 10 health.
### Meadowlark
The Meadowlark is identical in behavior to the Robin. There are 3 Meadowlarks present in the game.
### Cardinal
The Cardinal has an especially powerful attack that does 2 damage to a single target rather than just 1. Furthermore, its Power is also to make an identical attack for 2 damage. You may use either or both of these attacks on a given turn. 10 health.
### Blue Jay
The Blue Jay has no Power. However, its attack is extremely powerful. It does 1 damage each to up to 3 enemy birds. You may choose which, and if the enemy has 3 or fewer birds remaining, it will hit all of them.
### Oriole
The Oriole's Power is to give a friendly bird (or itself) a slice of cheddar cheese, healing it for 2 health points. It may only do this once per game. 1 damage, 10 health.
### Yellow Finch
The Yellow Finch has the Power to summon a random bird into existence to join your side. However, birds that themselves summon other birds are ineligible to be summoned. 1 damage, 10 health.
### Red-Winged Blackbird
The Red-Winged Blackbird does not have a typical Power that is used on your Power turn. However, it has a special ability. Due to its flashy coat, it may choose to draw the enemy's attention and absorb all damage from an attack that would otherwise damage another bird. It can even absorb damage from an attack that would hit multiple birds. It may use this ability once. 1 damage, 10 health.
### Eagle
The Eagle has the Power to steal an enemy bird and bring it over to your own side. The enemy bird keeps its own status, including its remaining health and whether its Power has been used (if applicable). However, this uses up your Eagle entirely. 1 damage, 10 health.
### Bluebird
The Bluebird is basically identical in behavior to the Robin, but it heals 5 health instead of 3. 1 damage, 5 health.
